# Communication Plan:

 - We will chat on slack channel and IRL.
 - Via slack but there’s obligation to respond if it’s after hours. We have lives.
 - Establishing norms that encourage equality in contributions, speaking time, and input and encouraging the expression of ideas. Think about your level of stress. Be polite and professional and express your frustration with someone 1/1 so we aren’t cutting each other down in front of each other.
 - Take frequent brain breaks so that we stay fresh!
