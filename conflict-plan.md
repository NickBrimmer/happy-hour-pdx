# Conflict Plan:

## In the event of a conflict:

 - Take a break and go for a walk.
 - Come back and try to find a middle ground.

## To try to prevent as much conflict as weak can:

 - Check in as a group 1-2 times per day to see what folks are working on and if they need any help
 - If someoneâ€™s not performing, ask them if they need help and see if we can support them.
 - Refer to the team for a democratic position, if they= team is evenly split talk to an outside mediator.
